### Welcome!

[Postcard](https://lextuga007.github.io/Postcard/) with my contact details.

I work as a Senior Information Analyst at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust working with both R and SQL. My main project area at the moment is Mortality Surveillance which involves creating and maintaining a dataset of all the trust's patients from across several clinical systems. 

I'm a Fellow of the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) and I am the Non-Exec Director at [AphA](https://www.aphanalysts.org/) (Assoc Professional Healthcare Analysts). 

I have a particular interest in Ethics having studied Philosophy and some of my thoughts on this, along with technical blogs, can be found on my blog [site](https://lextuga007.github.io/PhilosopherAnalyst/) and I'm also working on adapting the [Hugo site](https://upbeat-lumiere-00de50.netlify.app/) which I learned about at the rstudio::global(2021) conference as a part of my Diversity scholarship.
