### Welcome!

I work as a Senior Information Analyst at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust working with both R and SQL. My main project area at the moment is Mortality Surveillance which involves creating and maintaining a dataset of all patients from across several clinical systems. 

I'm a Fellow of the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) and I am the Non-Exec Director at [AphA](https://www.aphanalysts.org/) (Assoc Professional Healthcare Analysts). NHS colleagues can use [Hexitime](https://hexitime.com/) 

I have a particular interest in Ethics having studied Philosophy and some of my thoughts on this, along with technical blogs, can be found on my site https://lextuga007.github.io/PhilosopherAnalyst/
